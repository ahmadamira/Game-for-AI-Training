# Multiplayer Reaction Game

This is a simple reaction-based multiplayer game built with Python and Pygame. Players compete in rounds to score the highest by pressing their assigned keys as many times as possible within a 10-second timer. The game continues for five rounds, and the player with the most round wins is declared the overall winner.

## Game Features
- **Two-Player Mode**: Player 1 and Player 2 compete in timed rounds.
- **Rounds and Scoring**: Each round lasts 10 seconds, with players trying to score by pressing their assigned keys.
- **Progress Bar**: The screen visually updates with each player’s progress during a round.
- **Game Over and Restart Options**: After five rounds, the game declares a winner and provides an option to restart.

## How to Play
1. **Start a Round**: Press the `SPACE` key to begin each round.
2. **Score Points**:
   - Player 1 presses the `F` key to score points.
   - Player 2 presses the `L` key to score points.
3. **Game Duration**: Each round lasts 10 seconds, after which the round winner is displayed.
4. **Restart the Game**: After the game ends, press the `R` key to restart.

## Controls
- `F`: Player 1’s scoring key
- `L`: Player 2’s scoring key
- `SPACE`: Start a round
- `R`: Restart the game after it ends

## Installation and Setup

### Requirements
- **Python**: Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
- **Pygame**: Install Pygame by running the following command in your terminal:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```
### Run the Game
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. **Start the Game: Run the following command to start the game**:
   ```bash
   python <game-filename>.py
   ```
### Game Mechanics
- Each round’s score is calculated by counting the keypresses within the 10-second timer.
- After five rounds, the game evaluates the overall winner by tallying the round wins.
- A restart option allows players to reset all scores and start fresh.

### Future Enhancements
Possible improvements include:

- Adding sound effects for keypresses and round ends.
- Introducing power-ups or penalties to add variety to the rounds.
- Displaying live progress indicators for each player.
